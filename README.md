For the code to refactor in 
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php

In my assessment, the code effectively utilizes the Repository Design Pattern in Laravel, which is commendable as it separates the data access logic from the business logic, promoting a cleaner and more maintainable architecture. However, one critical aspect it lacks is the use of interfaces. Interfaces are crucial for defining contracts that the repository implementations must follow, enhancing both flexibility and testability.

To address this, I implemented an interface named BookingRepositoryInterface in the DTApi\Repository namespace. This interface includes methods for handling various booking-related operations, such as retrieving user jobs, storing job data, sending notifications, and more. This ensures a consistent contract for all repository implementations and improves code modularity, making the system easier to extend and maintain.

The source code is impressive overall, showcasing a solid understanding of the Repository Design Pattern. The logic appears sound, with methods that cover a wide range of necessary functionalities for a booking system.


For the Code to write tests (optional)
=====================
3) App/Helpers/TeHelper.php method willExpireAt
4) App/Repository/UserRepository.php, method createOrUpdate

In my assessment in method willExpireAt i change the variable name $difference to $differenceInHours to clearly indicate that it represents the difference in hours.
for the clarified conditions 
I change the condition to check for 90 minutes to <= 1.5 instead of <= 90 for clarity (since 90 minutes is 1.5 hours). Reordered conditions to ensure clarity and correct logical flow.
Changed $time to $expiryTime to clearly indicate its purpose.

In my assessment in method createOrupdate i refactor and create a method for 
1. findOrCreateModel
2. updateBasicInfo
3. shouldUpdatePassword
4. handleCustomerRole
5. createCompanyAndDepartmentForUser
6. handleTranslatorRole
7. updateUserMeta
8. updateBlacklist
9. updateUserLanguages
This refactoring separates concerns into distinct methods, making the code more modular, readable, and maintainable.
