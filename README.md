For the code to refactor in 
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php

In my assessment, the code effectively utilizes the Repository Design Pattern in Laravel. However, it lacks an interface. To address this, I created an interface named BookingRepositoryInterface 
in the Repository folder. 
The source code is impressive overall; it just needed this interface addition, which I've now implemented.

To enhance the structure and maintainability of the code, I implemented an interface named BookingRepositoryInterface in the DTApi\Repository namespace.
This interface includes methods for handling various booking-related operations, such as retrieving user jobs, storing job data, sending notifications, and more. 
This addition ensures a consistent contract for all repository implementations and improves code modularity.

Repository Design Pattern in Laravel is my best design patterns that i have been practicing and using before.

For the Code to write tests (optional)
=====================
3) App/Helpers/TeHelper.php method willExpireAt
4) App/Repository/UserRepository.php, method createOrUpdate

In my assessment in method willExpireAt i change the variable name $difference to $differenceInHours to clearly indicate that it represents the difference in hours.
for the clarified conditions 
I change the condition to check for 90 minutes to <= 1.5 instead of <= 90 for clarity (since 90 minutes is 1.5 hours). Reordered conditions to ensure clarity and correct logical flow.
Changed $time to $expiryTime to clearly indicate its purpose.

In my assessment in method createOrupdate i refactor and create a method for 
1. findOrCreateModel
2. updateBasicInfo
3. shouldUpdatePassword
4. handleCustomerRole
5. createCompanyAndDepartmentForUser
6. handleTranslatorRole
7. updateUserMeta
8. updateBlacklist
9. updateUserLanguages
This refactoring separates concerns into distinct methods, making the code more modular, readable, and maintainable.
